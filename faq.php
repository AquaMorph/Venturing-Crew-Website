<h2>What is Venturing about?</h2>
<p>Venturing is a co-ed scouting program for youth ages 14-21. The program is a branch of the organization known as Boy Scouts of America, or BSA. Other branches include the Boy Scouts, Sea scouts, Cub Scouts, and Varsity Scouts. The program is designed to be youth led, and teaches valuable skills, such as survival skills, leadership skills, and teamwork. Activities include high adventure camps such as Philmont, Sea base, and Summit Bechtel Reserve. We also go backpacking, kayaking and canoeing, among other activities.</p>
            
<h2>What is the Venturing Uniform?</h2>
<p>The official Venture Scout uniform consists of a green shirt similar to the Boy Scout's, and charcoal gray pants, either BSA official, or similar pants available from one of many brands. In Crew 208, we do not require this uniform. Instead, we use a green t-shirt the crew designed. This is the required uniform for all scout events, including meetings, and camping.</p>

<h2>What type of activities are typical to Venturing?</h2>
<p>We do everything from car camping, to Backpacking, to shooting. We also do watercraft activities (There are some limitations to to BSA guidelines), and service projects.</p>

<h2> If I join as a Boy Scout and want to complete the Venturing awards, would previous achievements count?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, no. All requirements for the awards must be completed while registered with a Venture Crew. Please note that at some point this year, a new advancement system will be put in place.</p>
