<p>Venturing Crew 208 is part of the Boy Scouts of America and is a coed high adventure program for youth ages 14-21. We are a youth led group, having our meetings and outings planned and run by the youth with some assistance from adult advisors. Throughout the year, our Crew plans backpacking, cycling, kayaking, and other trips to not only have fun, but also enhance skills in leadership, survival, and teamwork. </p>
            
<p>We meet the 1st and 3rd Mondays of every month at Christ the King Lutheran Church off of Walnut Street in Cary. Our meetings start at 6:30 PM and last about an hour. The first part of meetings cover logistics on upcoming events and outings while the second part covers a skills instruction or game.</p>
